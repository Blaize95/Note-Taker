# Module 11 Challenge - Note Taker

## Description
In this project, I was tasked with creating a note taker application, which allows users to take notes which are then saved and can also be deleted. This was achieved by building the back end and connecting it to the front end, and then deploying the entire application to Heroku. 

The application is currently live at: https://blaizes-note-taker-app.herokuapp.com/
